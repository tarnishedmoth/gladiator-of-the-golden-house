# Gladiator of the Golden House
Godot **4.6.stable**

Welcome!

There is a project overview board viewable in the Godot editor. You may be looking at it right now.
To access it, click on the *Board* tab at the top center of the screen. Pages are on the left, board editing tools are up top. Navigate a board by middle mouse click-and-drag to pan, mouse scroll to zoom, left click & right click to interact. You can drag and drop files from the FileSystem Dock. You can also click on the icon in the top left of files to open or show it in the FileSystem Dock.

A time tracker addon is also installed, and the gitignore is configured to ignore the savedata, so it only tracks your own time in the editor. This isn't uploaded or shared anywhere, it's just for your own personal reference, if you'd like to monitor how you spend time working in the project. There is a tab in the editor for the time tracker with the ability to pause, resume, and see all the time durations tracked. The tab can be moved anywhere in the editor.
