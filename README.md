# Gladiator of the Golden House
Current project editor version is Godot **4.6.stable**.

The Trello kanban board can be viewed here: https://trello.com/b/JwX7QjHx/gladiator-of-the-golden-house

The *Project Time Tracker* addon is installed, and the gitignore is configured to ignore local time tracking, so it only tracks your own time in the editor. This isn't uploaded or shared anywhere, it's just for your own personal reference, if you'd like to monitor how you spend time working in the project. There is a tab in the editor for the time tracker with the ability to pause, resume, and see all the time durations tracked.
